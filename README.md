#Desktop Version

Color Scheme
The color scheme for the desktop version uses two main colors
$rebel_red is a pinkish red and $stardust is a deep blue. Both colors were inspired by the artwork below david bowies face.
This piece was used for the background of the david bowie juke box.

# .starman classes

The starman class is a utility class used for headliners. The font used is called "Bangers" it is colored with $rebel_red.
There are 10 starman classes to use and each raises the font size by 12 pixels. You can use them by calling the class followed by a dash
and the number you wish to use. For instance .starman-1 would give you a headline that was 12px and starman-10 would give you a font-size of 120px.

# .buttons_from_mars

The buttons from mars use the same $rebel_red and $stardust colors. The colors invert when a user hovers over them. The use the font "permanent marker" and are
positioned absolutely on the right side of the screen.

# .ziggy_select

The ziggy selector is a dropdown selector. It uses the same $rebel_red and $stardust as well as the permanent marker font. before selecting the box
is transparent. In future iterations of the framework we hope to utilize jquery to design the drop down to have styling and perhaps icons next to each
choice.
